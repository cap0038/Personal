This is a small collection of code samples taken from previous projects. 
Samples will be added periodically.

The Senior Design examples are part of a project I worked on with four other team members. We worked with Rheem to help create a way to connect their customers' water heaters to all of the correct information so that the customer could be alerted if a leak or problem were detected in the water heater. The samples I pulled show screenshots of my contribution as well as coding samples.

The Auburn University example is a screenshot of my design for the Information Systems Support web page.
